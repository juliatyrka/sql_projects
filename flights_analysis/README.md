# ✈️ Flights Delay Analysis

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of flight delays using SQL queries run over a dataset of flight information. 
The goal is to identify patterns, averages, and percentages of flight delays to provide actionable insights for airlines, airports, and travelers.

## 📊 Key Analyses

- 🔍 Selection of all flight data from `flights.csv`
- 📈 Average delay per airline (arrival + departure)
- 🛫 Percentage of delayed flights (over 15 minutes) by origin airport

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** for querying structured data

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis uses a dataset named `flights.csv`:
- `arr_delay`: Arrival delay in minutes
- `dep_delay`: Departure delay in minutes
- `origin`: Origin airport code
- `name`: Airline name
